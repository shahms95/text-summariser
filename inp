Abstractâ€” Text Summarization is condensing the source
text into a shorter version preserving its information
content and overall meaning. It is very difficult for human
beings to manually summarize large documents of text. Text
Summarization methods can be classified into extractive
and
abstractive
summarization.
An
extractive
summarization method consists of selecting important
sentences, paragraphs etc. from the original document and
concatenating them into shorter form. The importance of
sentences is decided based on statistical and linguistic
features of sentences. An abstractive summarization method
consists of understanding the original text and re-telling it
in fewer words. It uses linguistic methods to examine and
interpret the text and then to find the new concepts and
expressions to best describe it by generating a new shorter
text that conveys the most important information from the
original text document. In this paper, a Survey of Text
Summarization Extractive techniques has been presented.
