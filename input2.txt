Peter Mukerjea wanted his son Rahul to move on after Sheena Bora had disappeared, claiming that she had “played him” and wanted to “get to something else”.
In a series of emails exchanged between father and son, which have been accessed by Hindustan Times, Rahul consistently held to the thought that something untoward had happened to Sheena, while Peter was insistent that she was fine, adding that anyone who was worried could speak to Indrani to be reassured.
After Rahul, in a May 27 email, said that Sheena had sent him “dodgy (contradictory) texts”, Peter wrote that “sheena is fine” and warned him that he was “wasting your time and breath in worrying about her”.
Peter further wrote that Sheena “...played you and now gone to something else... Why drive yourself in futility?”
